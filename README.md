As Indigenous peoples and local communities’ knowledge systems and culturally sensitive information become increasingly
digitized, this research project aims to better understand the gap between customary protocols and existing data
management practices, in order to develop a toolkit that contributes to better data governance and upholds principles of
Indigenous data sovereignty in the context of open-data research.
Current data governance trends increasingly emphasize the need to open access to data, despite growing concerns over
data privacy, control and surveillance. Indigenous peoples, with different epistemological traditions for the use and
sharing of culturally sensitive information, reinforce the growing concern of people’s ability to exert data
sovereignty, especially since they hold specific collective rights under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples. Thus, while interest grow on the documentation and use of Indigenous knowledge, current data governance trends
do not align well with Indigenous data rights and governance rules. This is the case of most data on Indigenous peoples
especially within EU open-data research.

The project aims to contribute to the work of leading organizations in the field, including the Global
Indigenous Data Alliance, the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance, Te Kotahi Research Institute, and Local
Contexts. The potential of this research is to help reframe how datasets concerning Indigenous peoples are interpreted
and managed in EU open research projects and consequently how Indigenous peoples’ knowledge is represented.

## About this repository

This repository contains the code for the RIDAGOP toolkit.
The Research on Indigenous Data Governance Protocols (RIDAGOP) toolkit tries to tackle some of these problems, by
allowing developers to create data-management processes that can interact with data repositories and can be used with
custom built websites, tailored to the requirements of individuals communities, peoples, institutions or requests.
